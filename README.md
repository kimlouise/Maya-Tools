Just a small plugin for Maya.  
Contains: 
  Custom command for moving the transform values to the offset parent matrix and back if needed.  If there are values within the offset parent matrix, they will be updated.
  Custom node for displaying text within the viewport.
  Another couple of custom nodes, that are no longer used.
